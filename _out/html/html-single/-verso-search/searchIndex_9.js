Their effects are accumulated from left to right. Sequentially composing programs\ncan be seen as a second program acting upon a first program. The difference with Functorial is that the second program\nmay be effectful. Effects of the second program can depend on the final value of the first program. We can define\nprograms that are sequentially composed in a formal way by defining a type class. This is what we do with the\nSequential type class.\n\nclass Sequential (program : Type → Type → Type) where\n  andThen {α β γ : Type} :\n    program α β → program β γ → program α γ\n\nexport Sequential (andThen)\n\ninfixl:50 \" >=> \" => andThen\n\n\nandThen also has infix notation >=>.\n\n"}});
