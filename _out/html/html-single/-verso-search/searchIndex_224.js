Capability combinations","context":"PSBP Documentation\u0009The  PSBP  Library type classes","contents":"The idea behind writing programs in terms of type classes like the ones defined so far is to use exactly those\ncapabilities that are necessary to write the programs. Some combinations of type classes are more expressive than\nother combinations. This implies that what you can do with them is more than what you can do the less expressive ones.\nBut this comes with a price. They are less flexible as far as implementation and corresponding materialization is\nconcerned than the less expressive ones.\n\n"}});
