Sequentially combining programs can be seen as a second program acting upon a\nfirst program. The difference with Functorial is that the second program may be effectful. Their effects are\naccumulated from left to right. Effects of the second program can depend on the final value of the first program. We can\ndefine programs that are sequentially combined in a formal way by defining a type class. This is what we do with the\nSequential type class.\n\nclass Sequential\n    (program : Type → Type → Type) where\n  andThen {α β γ : Type} :\n    program α β → program β γ → program α γ\n\nexport Sequential (andThen)\n\ninfixl:50 \" >=> \" => andThen\n\n\nandThen also has infix notation >=>.\n\n"}});
