Well, functions are what pure functional programming is all about.\nFunctions that are used as programs are effectfree. We can define functions as programs in a formal way by defining a\ntype class. This is what we do with the Functional type class.\n\nclass Functional\n    (program : Type → Type → Type) where\n  asProgram {α β : Type} :\n    (α → β) → program α β\n\nexport Functional (asProgram)\n\n\nA program, just like a function, transforms an initial value, its argument, to a final one, its result.\n\n"}});
