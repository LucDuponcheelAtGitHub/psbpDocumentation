About","context":"PSBP Documentation","contents":"This document is about the\nLean PSBP library,\nin what follows, also simply called PSBP.\n\nPSBP stands for \"Program Specification Based Programming\".\n\nThis document can be seen as a, somewhat special, not to say opinionated, programming course.\n\nThe course is especially useful for mathematicians and/or computer scientists, researchers as well as students\n(possibly future researchers), who are interested in mathematical foundations of programming.\n\nThe code of this document can be seen as a programming course for Lean.\n\nLean turns out to be both a very demanding and very helpful student.\n\nWhen I worked with Doatse Swierstra at the University of Utrecht, he once said to me that, apart from sound proving\ntechniques like \"proof by induction\", there is also this unsound proving technique \"proof by intimidation\". When no\nstudent complains about the correctness of a proof, the proof is correct. Of course, Doaitse did not apply this\ntechnique when teaching. Lean would be this very demanding student asking you for more and more proof details before\naccepting the correctness of the proof. But Lean would also be this very helpful student that would be able to infer\nthe proof details for you if you are sick and tired to go into more and more proof details.\n\nThe first sections of this course do not always explain all concepts they deal with. Please keep on reading. All\nconcepts will, eventually, be explained. Starting from section \"The PSBP Library type classes\", the course is\nself-contained and requires, at least in theory, no previous knowledge.\n\nSo let's end this section with a, somewhat offensive statement (I am sorry), hopefully motivation you to keep on reading\nthis document.\n\nIf Lean can understand the course then you should be able to understand it as well.\n\n"}});
