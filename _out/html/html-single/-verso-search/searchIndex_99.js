About","context":"PSBP Documentation","contents":"This document is about the\nLean PSBP library,\nin what follows, also simply called PSBP.\n\nThis document can be seen as a, somewhat special, not to say opinionated, programming course, especiallty useful for\nmathematicians and/or computer scientists, researchers as well as students, possible future researchers, who are\ninterested in mathematical foundations of programming.\n\nThe code of this document can be seen as a programming course for Lean itself. Lean turns out to be both a very\ndemanding and very helpful student.\n\nWhen I worked with Doatse Swierstra at the University of Utrecht, he once told me that, apart from sound proving\ntechniques like \"proof by induction\", there is also this unsound proving technique \"proof by intimidation\". When no\nstudent complains about the correctness of a proof, the proof is correct. Of course, Doaitse did not apply this\ntechnique when teaching. Lean would be this very demanding student asking you for more and more into proof details\nbefore accepting the correctness of the proof. But Lean would also be this very helpful student that would be able to\ninfer the proof details for you if you are stuck.\n\nThe first sections of this course do not always explain all concepts that they deal with. Please keep on reading. All\nconcepts will, eventually, be explained. Starting from section \"The PSBP Library type classes\" the course is self\ncontained and requires, at least in theory, no previous knowledge.\n\nSo let's end this section with a, somewhat offensive, motivation to keep on reading this document.\n\nIf Lean can understand the course then you should be able to understand it as well.\n\n"}});
