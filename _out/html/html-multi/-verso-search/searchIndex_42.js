Writing programs","context":"PSBP Documentation\u0009The  PSBP  library type classes","contents":"Programs are written in terms of members of type classes like the ones defined so far. The type class members are not\ndefined, they are declared. Type classes are specifications. The programs written in terms of their members are program\nspecifications, but, by abuse of language we call them programs.\n\nIt is challenging to limit the expressiveness of the type class combinations in terms of whose members programs are\nwritten. More specification expressivenes implies less implementation flexibility.\n\n"}});
